Loop unrolling consistently improves performance across all tested degrees and input sizes.
The degree-64 unrolling offers the most significant speedup, and the benefits of this
optimization technique become more pronounced with larger input sizes, making loop
unrolling a valuable strategy for reducing computational overhead, especially in scenarios
with extensive data processing.
